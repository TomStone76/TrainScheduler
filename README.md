This is a JavaScript app that allows users to input information about trains: their names, destinations, first arrival times, and frequencies. The app uses this information to tell the user when the next train will arrive, and how many minutes away it is. It uses Firebase to make the train data persist. You can view the deployed app here: https://tomstone76.github.io/TrainScheduler/
